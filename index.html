        "The 25 Pixley traditional queensland house, which was there for 96 years calls for conservation and respect, not demolition.",

        "Using the Olims/Watermark gardens for setback purposes in the plan seems questionable.",
        "The proposal includes utilizing the Watermark gardens as setback regions, a decision that warrants reconsideration. The same applies to the Olims (former Travelodge, heritage building).",
        "Designating the Watermark and Olim's gardens as buffer zones is not acceptable, as the new building must ensure it provides set backs on its own property and not just rely on the existing neighbour's free space.",
        "The decision to use the Watermark gardens and Olim's space as setback spaces do not align with the garden's original intent and will disrupt its charm.",

        "There's a discrepancy in the proposed drawings; the Watermark building is nearer than the stated 13 metres.",
        "The documentation seems to misrepresent the actual distance, as the Watermark building is significantly less than 13 metres away as depicted.",
        "The proposal seems to understate the distance to the Watermark building, suggesting it's more than the actual separation of less than 13 metres.",
        "It's observed that the specified 13 metres gap from the Watermark building in the design documents does not mirror reality.",

        "The proposed development might exacerbate traffic and parking woes on Pixley Street, already catering to 200 apartments.",
        "Given that 200 apartments already rely on Pixley Street for ingress and egress, the recent proposal's reduction in public parking spaces may intensify vehicular bottlenecks.",
        "Considering Pixley Street's pivotal role in facilitating access to 200 apartments, losing public parking slots will worsen the situation.",
        "The influx of added vehicles, coupled with a decrease in public parking provisions, could see Pixley Street's current situation, which supports 200 apartments, becoming untenable.",
